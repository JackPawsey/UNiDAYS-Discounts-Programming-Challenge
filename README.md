# UNiDAYS-Discounts-Programming-Challenge

Code written in C++ using Visual Studio 2017.

Copy and paste the entire code into a blank VS C++ Windows Desktop Application project to run.

Items can be added to the basket using "example.AddToBasket("A/B/C/D/E");"

*Note*
The delivery charge calculation is independant of discounts.
This means it is either a multiple of the number of items, or 0 if the total is over Â£50.00.
